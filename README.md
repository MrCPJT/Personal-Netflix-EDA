# Personal-Netflix-EDA

This is a WIP EDA of my personal Netflix data. Having recently begun using pandas I wanted to practice some exploratory data analysis and this is a dataset of interest to me!


Please see the `.ipynb` file for the current analysis. More analysis is to come with future commits.


The data is available as a `.csv` file for anyone interested! All of the profile names have been anonymised and I don't believe there are any other indicators of identity.
